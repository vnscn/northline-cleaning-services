                <h2>4. Pricing and Payment</h2>
                
                <h3>4.1 Pricing</h3>
                <p>Pricing is determined based on multiple factors including property size, condition, service tier, location, add-ons, and scheduling. Price quotes are valid for 7 days from issuance. The Company reserves the right to adjust pricing based on updated information or changed conditions.</p>

                <h3>4.2 Deposit Requirement</h3>
                <p>All services require a non-refundable 50% deposit at the time of booking confirmation. The deposit:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>Reserves your scheduled date and time</li>

                <p>The remaining 50% balance is due immediately upon completion of service. Accepted payment methods include cash, GCash, Maya, bank transfer, or check (subject to clearance). Service is not considered complete until final payment is received.</p>

                <h3>4.4 Additional Charges</h3>
                <p>Additional charges may apply if:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>You request work beyond the agreed scope on the service date</li>
                    <li>Property conditions differ materially from what was disclosed at booking</li>
                    <li>Access issues or delays caused by the Client extend service time</li>
                    <li>Special products or supplies are required and were not arranged in advance</li>
                </ul>
                <p>We will notify you of additional charges before proceeding with extra work.</p>

                <h2>5. Cancellation and Rescheduling</h2>
                
                <h3>5.1 Cancellation by Client</h3>
                <p>All cancellations result in forfeiture of the 50% deposit, regardless of timing or reason. The deposit is non-refundable to compensate the Company for reserved capacity and lost business opportunity.</p>

                <h3>5.2 Rescheduling</h3>
                <p>You may reschedule one time only without losing your deposit, subject to these conditions:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>At least 48 hours advance notice is provided</li>
                    <li>Rescheduling is to a date within 30 days of the original booking</li>
                    <li>The new date is subject to our availability</li>
                    <li>You accept the rescheduled date we offer</li>
                </ul>
                <p>If you reschedule and then cancel or fail to appear, your deposit is forfeited. There is no second rescheduling opportunity.</p>

                <h3>5.3 Same-Day Cancellation or No-Show</h3>
                <p>If you cancel on the day of service or fail to provide access when our team arrives, your deposit is forfeited and you will be charged an additional ₱500 trip fee. You will not be permitted to book future services until the trip fee is paid.</p>

                <h3>5.4 Cancellation by Company</h3>
                <p>We reserve the right to cancel service for:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>Unsafe working conditions</li>
                    <li>Undisclosed property conditions (hazards, hoarding, biohazards)</li>
                    <li>Threatening or disrespectful Client behavior</li>
                    <li>Force majeure events (natural disasters, government orders, public emergencies)</li>
                </ul>
                <p>If we cancel due to Client-caused conditions discovered on-site, the deposit is forfeited. If we cancel due to our own scheduling issues or force majeure before the service date, the deposit will be refunded or applied to a rescheduled service at your choice.</p>

                <h2>6. Client Responsibilities</h2>
                <p>To ensure proper service delivery, you must:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>Provide accurate and complete property information at booking</li>
                    <li>Remove clutter and personal items from surfaces before our arrival</li>
                    <li>Secure pets or keep them away from work areas</li>
                    <li>Disclose all areas to be cleaned, including locked rooms or restricted spaces</li>
                    <li>Provide access to water, electricity, and all areas to be serviced</li>
                    <li>Empty refrigerator, oven, or cabinets if interior cleaning is requested</li>
                    <li>Secure valuables, cash, jewelry, and fragile items</li>
                    <li>Disclose allergies, sensitivities, or product restrictions at booking</li>
                    <li>Be present or provide clear access instructions if you will be away</li>
                </ul>
                <p>Failure to meet these responsibilities may affect service quality, timing, or feasibility, and does not entitle you to refunds, discounts, or re-cleaning.</p>

                <h2>7. Quality Assurance and Re-Clean Policy</h2>
                
                <h3>7.1 Quality Standards</h3>
                <p>We aim to complete all cleaning tasks according to your chosen service tier. However, we do not guarantee specific outcomes, perfection, or removal of all stains or buildup. Results vary based on property conditions, material types, and pre-existing damage.</p>

                <h3>7.2 Reporting Issues</h3>
                <p>If you believe tasks within your service tier were missed or not completed to standard, you must notify us within 24 hours of service completion via email or Facebook Messenger, including specific details and photos if possible.</p>

                <h3>7.3 Free Re-Clean</h3>
                <p>If we determine that tasks were missed due to our oversight, we will provide one free re-clean limited strictly to the specific areas or tasks that were incomplete. The re-clean must be scheduled within 7 days of the original service.</p>

                <p>Re-clean is not available for:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>Tasks not included in your service tier</li>
                    <li>Undisclosed areas or conditions</li>
                    <li>Stains or damage that cannot be removed by cleaning</li>
                    <li>Personal preference differences without specific missed tasks</li>
                    <li>Issues reported after 24 hours</li>
                </ul>

                <h3>7.4 No Refunds</h3>
                <p>Once service is completed and final payment is made, we do not provide refunds under any circumstances. Your sole remedy for quality issues is the one-time free re-clean as described above.</p>

                <h2>8. Cleaning Products and Allergies</h2>
                <p>We use professional-grade commercial cleaning products suitable for most tasks. If you have allergies, sensitivities, or product restrictions, you must disclose these at the time of booking.</p>
                
                <p>You may choose to:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>Provide your own products (no additional charge)</li>
                    <li>Request we source specialty products (additional fee applies)</li>
                </ul>

                <p>If you provide your own products or request specific products, we cannot guarantee cleaning effectiveness. The Company is not liable for allergic reactions or sensitivities if you failed to disclose them at booking or if you approved use of standard products.</p>

                <h2>9. Liability and Indemnification</h2>
                
                <h3>9.1 Property Damage</h3>
                <p>We take reasonable care to avoid damage to your property. However, the Company is liable only for damage directly caused by our negligence or misuse of equipment. We are not liable for:</p>

                    <li>Damage to fragile items left in cleaning areas</li>
                    <li>Normal wear and tear or material deterioration</li>
                    <li>Damage resulting from hidden defects or poor property maintenance</li>
                </ul>
                <p>Maximum liability per incident is ₱5,000 or the actual cost of repair, whichever is less. You must report damage within 24 hours with photographic evidence.</p>

                <h3>9.2 Loss or Theft</h3>
                <p>The Company is not liable for loss or theft of unsecured valuables, cash, jewelry, documents, or personal items. You are responsible for securing these items before our arrival.</p>

                <h3>9.3 Personal Injury</h3>
                <p>The Company is not liable for injuries you sustain during or as a result of service, except where directly caused by our gross negligence or willful misconduct.</p>

                <h3>9.4 Indemnification</h3>
                <p>You agree to indemnify and hold harmless the Company, its owners, employees, and agents from any claims, damages, losses, or expenses arising from:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>Your failure to disclose property conditions or hazards</li>
                    <li>Your breach of these Terms & Conditions</li>
                    <li>Third-party claims related to your property or conduct</li>
                </ul>

                <h2>10. Access and Security</h2>
                <p>If you provide keys, access codes, or security information, we will safeguard this information and use it solely for scheduled services. You are responsible for changing codes or locks after service ends. The Company is not liable for security breaches occurring after our access period.</p>

                <h2>11. Force Majeure</h2>
                <p>Neither party is liable for failure to perform obligations due to events beyond reasonable control, including but not limited to natural disasters, government restrictions, public health emergencies, civil unrest, utility failures, or severe weather. In such cases, we may reschedule or cancel service. Deposits paid for services canceled due to force majeure before the service date will be refunded or credited at your choice.</p>

                <h2>12. Limitation of Liability</h2>
                <p>To the fullest extent permitted by law, the Company's total liability for any claim arising from or related to our services shall not exceed the amount you paid for the specific service giving rise to the claim. The Company is not liable for indirect, consequential, special, or punitive damages.</p>

                <h2>13. Privacy and Data Protection</h2>
                <p>We collect and use your personal information in accordance with our Privacy Policy. By booking services, you consent to the collection, use, and storage of your information as described in the Privacy Policy.</p>

                <p>The Company reserves the right to modify these Terms & Conditions at any time. Changes will be posted on our website with an updated effective date. Your continued use of services after changes are posted constitutes acceptance of the modified terms.</p>

                <h2>15. Governing Law and Dispute Resolution</h2>
                <p>These Terms & Conditions are governed by the laws of the Republic of the Philippines. Any disputes arising from or related to these terms or our services shall be resolved through good faith negotiation. If negotiation fails, disputes shall be submitted to the appropriate courts in Misamis Oriental, Philippines.</p>

                <h2>16. Severability</h2>
                <p>If any provision of these Terms & Conditions is found to be invalid or unenforceable, the remaining provisions shall continue in full force and effect.</p>

                <h2>17. Entire Agreement</h2>
                <p>These Terms & Conditions, together with our Privacy Policy and any service-specific agreements, constitute the entire agreement between you and Northline Cleaning Services regarding the services.
